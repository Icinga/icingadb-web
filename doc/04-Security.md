# Security

Icinga DB Web allows users to send commands to Icinga. Users may be restricted to a specific set of commands,
by use of **permissions**.

The same applies to routes, objects and variables. To these, users can be restricted by use of **restrictions**.

## Permissions

> **Restricted Command Permissions:**
>
> If a role [limits users](#filters) to a specific set of results, the granted command permissions of the very same
> role only apply to these results. The [`icingadb/scope/commands`](#scopes) restriction has the same effect.

## Restrictions

### Filters

Filters limit users to a specific set of results.

> **Note:**
>
> Filters from multiple roles will widen available access.

| Name                     | Description                                                            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| icingadb/filter/objects  | Restrict access to the Icinga objects that match the filter            |
| icingadb/filter/hosts    | Restrict access to the Icinga hosts and services that match the filter |
| icingadb/filter/services | Restrict access to the Icinga services that match the filter           |

`icingadb/filter/objects` will only allow users to access matching objects. This applies to all objects,
not just hosts or services. It should be one or more [filter expressions](#filter-expressions).

`icingadb/filter/hosts` will only allow users to access matching hosts and services. Other objects remain
unrestricted. It should be one or more [filter expressions](#filter-expressions).

`icingadb/filter/services` will only allow users to access matching services. Other objects remain unrestricted.
It should be one or more [filter expressions](#filter-expressions).

### Scopes

Scopes don't limit users in what they can see, just in what they can do where.

| Name                    | Description                                                                |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| icingadb/scope/commands | Restrict to which objects the command permissions a role grants will apply |

`icingadb/scope/commands` will limit where the granted command permissions of a role will apply.
It should be one or more [filter expressions](#filter-expressions).

### Denylists

Denylists prevent users from accessing information and in some cases will block them entirely from it.

> **Note:**
>
> Denylists from multiple roles will further limit access.

Name                         | Description
-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------
icingadb/denylist/routes    | Prevent access to routes that are part of the list
icingadb/denylist/variables | Hide custom variables of Icinga objects that are part of the list

`icingadb/denylist/routes` will block users from accessing defined routes and from related information elsewhere.
For example, if `hostgroups` are part of the list a user won't have access to the hostgroup overview nor to a host's
groups shown in its detail area. This should be a comma separated list. Possible values are: hostgroups, servicegroups,
contacts, contactgroups

`icingadb/denylist/variables` will block users from accessing certain custom variables. A user affected by this won't
see that those variables even exist. This should be a comma separated list of [variable paths](#variable-paths). It is
possible to use [match patterns](#match-patterns).

### Protections

Protections prevent users from accessing actual data. They will know that there is something, but not what exactly.

> **Note:**
>
> Denylists from multiple roles will further limit access.

Name                       | Description
---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
icingadb/protect/variables | Obfuscate custom variable values of Icinga objects that are part of the list

`icingadb/protect/variables` will replace certain custom variable values with `***`. A user affected by this will still
be able to see the variable names though. This should be a comma separated list of [variable paths](#variable-paths).
It is possible to use [match patterns](#match-patterns).

### Formats

#### Filter Expressions

These consist of one or more [filter expressions](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-web-2/latest/doc/06-Security/#filter-expressions).

Allowed columns are:

* host.name
* service.name
* hostgroup.name
* servicegroup.name
* host.user.name
* service.user.name
* host.usergroup.name
* service.usergroup.name
* host.vars.[\<variable path\>](#variable-paths)
* service.vars.[\<variable path\>](#variable-paths)

#### Match Patterns

Match patterns allow a very simple form of wildcard matching. Use `*` in any place to match zero or any characters.

#### Variable Paths

Icinga DB Web allows to express any custom variable depth in variable paths. So they may be not just names.

Consider the following variables:

```
vars.os = "Linux"
vars.team = {
  name = "Support",
  on-site = ["mo", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fr"]
}
```

To reference `vars.os`, use `os`. To reference `vars.team.name`, use `team.name`. To reference `vars.team.on-site`,
use `team.on-site[0]` for the first list position and `team.on-site[4]` for the last one.

Combined with a [match pattern](#match-patterns) it is also possible to perform a *contains* check: `team.on-site[*]`
